# User Interfaces

A focus for Multivac is providing flexible user interfaces for GenAI applications.  So far this includes:

* A Web Application using Chainlit found at https://multivac.sunholo.com
* API access to underlying VAC microservices when you have been issued a `MULTIVAC_API_KEY`
* Terminal Command Line Interface (CLI) via the `sunholo[cli]` extension
* Chat bot interfaces such as Discord, GChat and Teams
* Streaming audio/video via LiveKit integrations
* Desktop client applications via tools such as https://jan.ai
* Any OpenAPI compatible tool will work with a VAC API call - even if you are calling a non-OpenAI model.  

An individual VAC could also create its own UI, since its being served via a HTTP container.
